# SCSS Grid System

ðŸš€ **Lightweight, Highly Configurable Flexbox/SCSS Grid System**

A lightweight alternative to Bootstrap, emulating the 12-column flexbox grid system. This system adds advanced functionality like easily re-definable breakpoints, customizable container widths, and gutter widths, while also omitting unnecessary bloat. The entire demo, with theming and all components enabled, compiles to just **11kb** with PurgeCSS.

## Key Features

- **Highly Configurable**: Adjust container width, padding, and gutter width per breakpoint.
- **Advanced Spacing**: Margin and padding can be relative to the defined gutter width.
- **Grid Components**: Includes components like spacing, height classes, ordering, shift/overflow, and more.
- **Toggle Components**: Enable/disable components to minimize the CSS file size.
- **CSS Variables**: Easily reference column or gutter width with CSS variables.
- **Lightweight**: The entire demo, including theming, is compiled to just **11kb** with PurgeCSS.

**Press 'G' to show/hide the grid.**

## Grid Configuration

All grid settings, including enabling/disabling components, defining breakpoints, spacing values, and container sizes, can be adjusted in the `_grid-config.scss` file.
